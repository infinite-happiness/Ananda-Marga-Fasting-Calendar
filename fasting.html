        <h1>Ánanda Márga Upavása (Fasting) System</h1>
        <div id="table-of-contents" class="margin"></div>
        <h2>Upavása</h2>
        <p>Voluntary fasting on certain days is called upavása. It doesn't actually mean going without food.</p>
        <article class="yellow2">
            «The scriptural meaning of upavása is – by derivation – upa, which means “near”, and vása, which means “to
            stay”. Upavása therefore means “to make the mind stay near Paramátmá*”. In other words, it means to
            withdraw the mind from thoughts of physicalities and keep it near Paramátmá*.»

        </article>
        <h2>Positive Effects</h2>
        <p>There are many positive effects you may experience during fasting and even in the following days. You may
            feel a deeper spiritual connection, creative inspiration, gratitude, connection with nature, sharpened
            senses and healed both mentally and physically. If the fasting day is difficult you may still experience
            positive effects after breaking. If you don't experience the positive effects the first time, they will
            probably come later. They will definitely come if you practice Ánanda Márga Tantra Yoga in a sincere and
            balanced way regularly, and observe upavása according to your health.</p>
        <h2>Who Should Fast</h2>
        <p>Healthy adult Ánanda Márga practioners, Ánanda Márgiis, should observe upavása (fasting). Anyone
            with health issues (physical or mental) should adjust the fasting according to their health.</p>
        <h2>When To Fast</h2>
        <p>
            Ánanda Márgiis normally observe upavása twice per lunar month – during ekádashii. Ánanda Márga
            Sanyásiis observe upavása four times per lunar month, during the tithis ekádashii, amávasyá
            (new moon) and púrńimá (full moon). More information on how the dates are determined, and the tithis, are
            explained on the <a class="yellow10-text" href="science.html">science</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>Find out when the fasting days occur at the <a class="yellow10-text" href="index.html">calendar</a> page.</p>
        <p>If upavása cannot be observed during the given dates, the day before or after can be used.</p>
        <article class="yellow2">
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                According to the Ánanda Márga Scientific Fasting Calendar (AMSFC), Ekádashii occurs Sunday 13 October
                2024. This means that all Ánanda Márgiis (including Sanyásiis) should observe upavása this day.
                Anyone who is unable to fast this day can use October 12th or 14th as the fasting day.

        <h2>How To Fast</h2>
        <h3>Fasting Preparations</h3>
        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Make sure you have the necessary ingredients and utensils available at home (see How To Break Fast).
                Make sure to prepare this when you are feeling strong (for example in the beginning of the fasting day).
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you have warmer clothes and blankets than normally available, since you may feel colder than
                normal (especially if you often feel cold) during the fasting day, and even the day after.</li>
            <li>Read through the fasting method and breaking procedure when you are feeling strong, so that you have an
                idea of what to expect, and know how to break fast before you need to do it.</li>
            <li>Decide what you will eat the day after fasting, and make any necessary breakfast preparations the day
                before breaking fast. </li>
            <li>If this is your first time fasting, it's best if you can spend your fasting day, as well as the morning
                after (when you are breaking fast), with experiences Ánanda Márgiis. Although the fasting procedure is
                not that difficult, there may me many practical questions that are better answered in conversation
                rather than in text format. If it's difficult for you to do this, at least consult with your Ácárya or
                any Didi, Dada or experienced Márgii who is available for you.
            </li>
            <li>It's good to be well aware of the upcoming fasting day the day before the fasting day, in the morning,
                so that you are mentally prepared.</li>
            <li>On your selected fasting day, make sure you can handle whatever tasks you are planning to do that day.
                It can be hard to perform hard or difficult work, if you feel weak, nauseous or get impaired motor
                control or balance.</li>
            <li>You should have plenty of time to break fast calmly, especially if it's your first time, if you have
                health issues, or if you'd have problems with fasting or breaking fast before. The procedure may take
                hours. So plan your fasting days accordingly.</li>
            <li>As a general health rule, Ánanda Márga recommends drinking plenty of water. This is especially
                important before and
                after fasting days.

                <article class="yellow2">
                    “Truly, all types of disease can be relieved if one knows how to use water properly. To maintain
                    the internal functions of the body without hindrance and to maintain the internal liquid
                    balance, everyone should drink a sufficient quantity of water every day. A healthy person can
                    consume three or four seers (liters*) of water a day, a sick person four or five seers
                    (liters*), and a person suffering from skin disease, five or six seers (liters*). These amounts
                    of water help cure a disease to a great extent.
                    <p>Drinking water is good, but water with a little lemon and a little salt is still better.</p>
                    <p>Drinking a lot of water at a time is harmful**, especially for heart patients.”</p>

                        * The tola and the seer, Indian units of weight, have been used in this book. 1 tola=11.664
                        grams. 1 seer=80 tolas=933.12 grams. 1 seer water at 4 degrees C occupies 0.93312 litre.</p>
                    <p>** Not more than 0.7 liters per hour, or two glasses at once, should be consumed.</p>

            </li>
            <li>Observing upavása will be easier, especially if you struggle, when you don't eat heavy or oily food, or
                food that is hard to digest, the day before fasting. Instead, eat something that is easy to digest, but
                still nutritious, balanced and complete, for the whole day before, as well as after, fasting. A good
                meal suggesion is khicuri (rice, pulse and vegetables cooked together), commonly spelled “kitchari”.
                Remember to make it sáttvika (sattvic): vegetarian without any type of onion, garlic, leek, chive,
                mushroom, egg, fish, poultry or meat. Also, don't mix too many different things together, don't eat too
                many meals or snacks between meals.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting Duration</h3>
        <p>Fasting starts when you go to bed the night before the fasting day, and ends at sunrise the day after fasting
            day.</p>
        <h3>Fasting Method</h3>
        <p>The general fasting method is to not eat or drink anything. Some Márgiis drink some water in the morning of
            the fasting day. Fasting without water is strictly forbidden for all tuberculosis patients.</p>
        <article class="yellow2">
            “During fasting the body’s organs get a good rest, and the healing process is more rapid. It is possible for
            one to get relief even from chronic skin diseases if one goes on a long fast and drinks plenty of water with
            lemon juice.
            <p>
                Only persons in very good health and with good energy should fast without water. Persons suffering from
                gall or kidney-stones should never undertake a waterless fast. Sick persons and people in mediocre
                health should observe fasting taking plenty of lemon juice and water. Persons who are very weak may take
                a small quantity of fruit and milk. Persons who, for whatever reason, do not fast on Ekádashii,
                Púrńimá and Amávasyá should at least abstain from taking rice, fried vegetables, pulses and
                non-vegetarian food on those days. They should also take just a little milk, fruit and dry
                things on the evenings of Púrńimá and Amávasyá.”</p>

        <h3>Difficulties</h3>
        <p>If you have never fasted before, or if you have only fasted a few times, or if you haven't fasted in a long
            time, or if you have (or have had) health issues, fasting or breaking the fast can be difficult. You may
            feel weak, hungry, thirsty, sick, get impaired mobility or balance, or have other difficulties. The
            difficulties may come and go, they may be stronger at certain times of day, or before breaking fast. Even
            after breaking fast, and having a meal or even for the whole day, things may be a bit out of the normal.
            Consult with your Ácárya or an available Didi or Dada if you have difficulties.</p>
        <p>Fasting and breaking fast are different for every person, and you will have to learn what works for you by
            experience. It will get easier with time, especially if you do the spiritual practices in a balanced and
            sincere way. When it becomes easier it can become very inspiring and you will feel the health benefits as
            well. </p>
        <h3>Extreme Methods</h3>
        <p>Some people perform and advocate rather extreme fasting methods, and breaking methods. Although fasting is
            such a powerful spiritual practice that can be life changing, don't let the inspiration acquired from it
            give you extreme ideas about fasting. It's much better for health to do the fasting twice a month regularly
            for years and years, rather than to do something extreme like fasting an extra day one time when you are
            extra inspired.</p>
        <p>Another idea is to drink large or even huge amounts of lemon water when breaking fast. This is dangerous and
            can cause harm.</p>
        <p>
            If you want to push yourself with fasting it's better to do it four times per month regularly, and maintain
            the inspiration over a longer period of time. This is acceptable by the Guru.</p>
        <p>
            If you really want to push yourself, you should use that inspiration to become regular and balanced with the
            whole of Ánanda Márga practices. Years of such sincere regularity is what will transform your life
            completely, making you able to contribute the best way possible to the world.</p>
        <h2>How To Break Fast</h2>
        <p>
            After sunrise the day after the fasting day it is time to break fast. Decide how you will do morning
            meditation, bath and asanas in relation to the breaking of fast.</p>
        <h3>Things You Need</h3>
        <ul class="margin">
            <li>A lemon or two per person (or a few limes).</li>
            <li>An overripe banana or two per person</li>
            <li>A few teaspons of salt per person</li>
            <li>Several liters of drinking water per person</li>
            <li>Heat resistant jug (1 liter is a good size)</li>
            <li>Kettle (for boiling water)</li>
            <li>Citrus press (not absolutely necessary)</li>
            <li>Measurement for one teaspoon (5 ml)</li>
            <li>Measurement for one liter (perhaps you can use the kettle)</li>
            <li>Spoon or fork</li>
            <li>Knife</li>
            <li>Cutting Board</li>
            <li>Cup or glass</li>
            <li>Ingredients for breakfast and healthy meals during the day</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Heat up 1 liter of drinking water. (It's better not to boil it, but instead heat it up to a good
                temperature for drinking. It should not be too hot since it takes too long time to drink, but
                like a hot drink that is not too hot, so you can drink it as fast as you drink water. For example, you
                can heat the water until the kettle starts to make a noise. You can make a note for how many seconds it
                takes for you to heat up one liter of water to your preferred temperature.)</li>
            <li>Add the heated water and two teaspoons of salt to the jug.</li>
            <li>If you don't have any lemon (or lime), you can drink the salt water. However, it's strongly recommended
                to add the lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out the lemon juice from half or the whole of a lemon (or one or two limes) with the citrus
                press.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice to the jug.</li>
            <li>Stir the jug. You now have lemon water.</li>
            <li>Drink the lemon water. Not too fast (don't rush), and not too slow (it shouldn't take hours to drink one
                liter).</li>
            <li>If you can, you can move around or do asanas or the Kaoshikii dance, to improve digestion.</li>
            <li>If you're not used to this, you may feel like you need to pass gas, but be careful, as it might be the
                liquid coming out.</li>
            <li>The liquid should come out as liquid poop (solid poop may come first).</li>
            <li>You may also vomit, which is not necessarily a bad sign, as it's a way to clean the stomach. If you
                vomit a lot you should probably drink more lemon water, so that some of it goes through the body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the liquid is not coming out as poop, you may try to move more, or drink more lemon water (perhaps with
            more salt). This procedure is very individual, and it gets easier with experience.
        </p>
        <p>After you have pooped out most of the lemon water, you can drink some normal, fresh drinking water. Then,
            before eating breakfast, eat one or two overripe bananas slowly. Make sure to drink plenty of water during
            the day, and eat in a way that is more kind than normal to your stomach.</p>
