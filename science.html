        <h1>Science of Ananda Marga Upavasa Fasting</h1>
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Ananda Marga upavása fasting dates are based on the Vedic solar day (sunrise to sunrise) which occur
            closest to the relevant lunar phases (ekádashii, amávasyá/new moon and púrńimá/full moon).
            The lunar phases are always the same around earth, and the their calculated values are quite consistent
            around the web. Sunrise however is something very complex to calculate, and needs to be defined properly in
            order to decide the correct fasting day.
        </p>
        <p>This software, the <strong>Ánanda Márga Upavása Fasting Calendar (AMUFC)</strong>, uses scientic models
            for the calculations, and offers the possibility to use your position, time zone, and sunrise of choice, for
            calculating fasting days.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            Many of the technicalities for the fasting chart are explained on the
            <a class="yellow10-text" href="https://ampsnys.org/fasting-calendar/" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noopener">Ananda
                Marga – New York
                Sector's
                website</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here follows some quotes from that website:<br />
            <code>The actual fasting day is calculated to include most of the indicated lunar phase.</code>
            <br />
            <code>Calculations follow the Indian convention of starting the days at dawn rather than midnight.</code>
            <br />
            <code>These calculations for fasting dates are based on instructions given by Guru Bábá to Ac. Jagadiishvarananda Avt. who was responsible for printing the Ananda Marga Diary. The Diary has always included the official fasting dates for Ananda Marga. Dada explained the system in 1976, reflected in the notes below…</code>
            <br />
            <code>For Ekadashi, (literally the 11th day after the new and full moons), we begin with the starting and ending times of the lunar day (...). The system is that the proper fasting day will be the solar day (from sunrise to sunrise) whose maximum time falls within the starting and ending times of the Ekadashi lunar day. The source data is based in Varanasi, India as per instruction by Guru Bábá.</code>
            <code>For those who fast on Purnima (full moon) and Amavasya (new moon), the same process is followed.</code>
            <br />
            <!--<code> For those who do night meditation on the new moon, those calculations are also included (1st Night).</code>-->
        </p>

        <h2>Moon Phases</h2>
        <p>Moon phases such as new and full moon can be described as degrees of a circle. Such a circle is illustrated
            in the video and image below:</p>

        <h2>Tithis</h2>
        <p>The relevant moon phases for Ananda Marga fasting are called tithis. At the time of writing, you can see on
            the fasting chart on the <a class="yellow10-text" href="https://www.anandamarga.eu/fastingChart.php"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Official Website of Ananda Marga in Europe - Berlin Sector</a>,
            that the start and end
            times are based on tithis (specifically, the times of the tithis named ekádashii, amávasyá and púrńimá
            are displayed).</p>
        <p>Moon phases are always the same all over earth, and most tithi calculations around the web just differ with a
            few minutes of time (and are displayed in India Standard Time).
        </p>
        <h3>The Relevant Tithis for Ananda Marga Upavasa Fasting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ekádashii (11 tithis/lunar days after new/full moon): occurs at angles 120° - 132° and 300° -
                312°</li>
            <li>Amávasyá (New Moon): occurs at angles 348° - 360°</li>
            <li>Púrńimá (Full Moon): occurs at angles 168° - 180°</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the tithis occur, and how long they are, are not that simple to calculate. Quite some knowledge
            of astromony and mathematics is required (or in the case of this software, the AMUFC, astronomical software
            libraries were used for the calculations. See <a class="yellow10-text" href="code.html">Code</a>.)</p>
        <h4>Understanding the Definitions of Ekádashii, Amávasyá, and Púrńimá</h4>
        <p>Other than ekádashii occuring 11 tithis after new/full moon, ekádashii starts exactly 120° after the moment
            of new/full moon. That is exactly one third of the circled path the moon travels around earth. Furthemore,
            the start of ekádashii until the moment of the upcoming new/full moon is exactly 60° of the moon's path
            around earth. So if you imagine the lunar path around earth forming a geometric shape in
            space, starting with ekádashii and ending with new/full moon, a 60° arc is formed. If you let
            the arc start with new/full moon and end with the beginning ekádashii, a 120° arc is formed.
        </p>
        <img src="media/Moon-Paths-Ekadashii-Amavasya-Purnima.svg">
        <p>Amávasyá and púrńimá are lunar days which end at the moment of new/full moon respectively.</p>
        More about 60° angles:
        <ul>
            <li>60° angles are found in equilateral triangles and the unit circle in trigonometry.</li>
            <li>The unit circle is a fundamental tool in astronomy because of its connection to trigonometry.</li>
            <li>The pratik consists of two equilateral triangles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>WikiPedia on Tithis:</h3>

        <code>
            In Vedic timekeeping, a tithi is a "duration of two faces of moon that is observed from earth", known as
            milа̄lyа̄ (Newar: 𑐩𑐶𑐮𑐵𑐮𑑂𑐫𑐵𑑅, मिलाल्याः) in Nepal Bhasa, or the time it takes for the longitudinal
            angle between the Moon and the Sun to increase by 12°. In other words, a tithi is a time duration between
            the consecutive epochs that correspond to when the longitudinal angle between the Sun and the Moon is an
            integer multiple of 12°. Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration approximately from 19 to
            26 hours. Every day of a lunar month is called tithi.

        <h3>Calculating Fasting Dates Without Tithis</h3>
        <p>
            This is just an idea that could be used as an alternative method if ever needed. Since it's easier
            to find programming libraries that calculate dawn, new moon and full moon, an alternative method to get a
            fasting date could be to get the geocentric phase angle at the sunrises/dawns that occur near the tithis.
        </p>
        <p>
            This way you wouldn't calculate the time which the tithi spans over the solar day, but instead which
            angle
            the sunrises near the tithi has. You can then calculate which solar day is the closest to the tithi
            by
            angular comparison, rather than time span.
        </p>
        <code>
            For example, suppose sunrise<sub>1</sub> is when the lunar phase is 130°. This means the sunrise<sub>1</sub>
            is during Ekádashii (120° - 132°). Sunrise<sub>0</sub> is at lunar phase 118°, and sunrise<sub>2</sub> is at lunar phase 142°.
            <br>
            The day between sunrise<sub>0</sub> and sunrise<sub>1</sub> spans over the lunar phase between 118° and 130°, and 8° of those are during Ekádashii.
            <br>
            The day between sunrise<sub>1</sub> and sunrise<sub>2</sub> spans over the lunar phase between 130° and 142°, and 2° of those are during Ekádashii.
            <br>
            So the conclusion is that the day between sunrise<sub>0</sub> and sunrise<sub>1</sub> is the fasting day, since 8° is larger than 2°.
        </code>

        <h2>Dawn and Sunrise</h2>
        <p>Ananda Marga's fasting system uses the Vedic solar day to determine the date of a day. In some ways
            it's
            natural to think of the day starting in the morning. The day actually starts in the morning (when
            most
            people wake up), rather than in the middle of the night (when most people are asleep, or have not
            even gone
            to bed yet). However, there are number of problems that arise when using sunrise as the start and
            end of the
            day.
        </p>
        <h3>Issues of Calculating Sunrise and Dawn</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The day starts at a different time every day, and needs to be calculated.
            </li>
            <li>The day starts at different times in different locations and elevations above sea level - even
                when
                those locations are within the same time zone. The accuracy of the position also affects
                calculations.
            </li>
            <li>The definition of sunrise differ from place to place, even within the Vedic community (see <a
                    class="yellow10-text"
                    href="https://www.quora.com/In-Hindu-culture-does-the-new-day-start-at-12-00-AM" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">this discussion</a>
                and <a class="yellow10-text"
                    href="https://www.quora.com/At-what-time-does-a-day-start-according-to-the-Hindu-calendar"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a>). This has a rather big impact on calculating
                the fasting day, since
                the choice of sunrise definition sometimes moves the fasting day from one day to another.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, in some places (far north and far south), during summer and winter, there are no
                sunrises. Namely during midnight sun and polar night (or depending on the definition of sunrise, a
                larger part of the world).</li>
            <li>Atmospheric refraction, which causes celestial bodies to appear higher above the horizon than
                they would if the Earth had no atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Defining Sunrise</h3>
        <p>To get the Ananda Marga fasting system correct, we need to define the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a sunrise? In other words, when exactly does the solar day start? At what position of the sun?
            </li>
            <li>What is a sunrise during midnight sun and polar night? In other words, what happens when the defined
                position of sunrise does not occur, because it is not reached certain days of the year?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sunrise should probably be astronomical, nautical or civil dawn (see illustration below), or when the top of
            the sun peeks above the horizon.</p>

        <h3>Calculating Sunrise </h3>
        <p>These values are used for calculating sunrise/dawn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date and time</li>
            <li>Latitude and Longitude</li>
            <li>Elevation of the location above sea level</li>
            <li>Height above ground (depending on the definition of sunrise). This height is above the
                elevation, for
                example considering the height of a person, and their position (sitting or standing, on the
                ground or at the top of a skyscraper).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are different concepts of dawn and sunrise in modern science. On the illustration below you can
            see that the sun is below the horizon during different twilights, and in the center of the horizon at
            sunrise. The beginning of these twilights are sometimes refered to as dawn (astronomical, nautical and civil
            dawn).

        <h3>Comparisons With Other Published Calendars</h3>
        <p>The fasting dates on different Ananda Marga websites on the web are different. However, some of them
            use the exact same dates, although they are in different time zones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a class="yellow10-text" href="https://www.anandamarga.eu/fastingChart.php" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">Official Website of Ananda Marga in Europe - Berlin Sector</a></li>
            <li><a class="yellow10-text" href="https://india.anandamarga.org/fasting-calendar/" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">Ananda Marga India - Delhi Sector</a>
            </li>
            <li><a class="yellow10-text" href="https://hks.amps.org/fasting-chart/" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">Ananda Marga Hong Kong Sector</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The fasting dates on the above web sites all correspond to the table below. These dates were
            compared to the calculations of this software (AMUFC).
            It can be concluded with high probability that the tithi times are based on Asia/Kolkata (Varanasi)
            time zone, as well as the chosen days for fasting.
        </p>
        <h4>Different Types of Dawn - and Coordinates of Varanasi</h4>
        <p>
            Comparisons were made using sunrise and the different types of dawn. The accuracy when comparing
            this
            software's
            calculations with the table below were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Astronomical Dawn: 88%</li>
            <li>Nautical Dawn: 88%</li>
            <li>Civil Dawn: 86%</li>
            <li>Sunrise: 84%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since astronomical dawn and nautical dawn had the same accuracy, astronomical dawn was the selected
            method
            to use.
            The rationale is that it makes the most sense if the beginning of the day is the actual beginning of
            something, and
            the astronomical dawn is the first dawn.
        </p>
        <h4>Differences</h4>
        <p>
            The reasons 100% accuracy wasn't achieved:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The calculations of tithis and sunrise are not exactly the same. Usually the difference is
                small, and
                still the
                chosen fasting day is different because the tithi spans over similarly over both two solar days.
                The
                sunrise
                also depends on altitude, which is not taken into account in this software.</li>
            <li>Some of the official fasting days are miscalculated (probably mistaken because of human error).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Example - Calculation Difference</h5>
        <h6>This Calculator</h6>
        <p>
            Amávasyá (New Moon) - 11 Jan 2024
            <br />
            Amavasya start: 10 Jan 2024, 08:12 PM Varanasi time
            <br />
            Amavasya end: 11 Jan 2024, 05:27 PM Varanasi time
            <br />
            Astronomical Dawn: 11 Jan 2024, 06:24 AM Varanasi time
            <br />
            Amavasya start to sunrise: 10:11:28
            <br />
            Sunrise to Amavasya end: 11:03:27
        </p>

        <h6>The Official Calculations</h6>
        <p>
            I don't know how they calculated the sunrise/dawn, but you can see from the calculation that the
            sunrise is
            almost
            at the center of the tithi,
            so it's possible their sunrise value made their fasting day on Jan 10th.
        </p>

        <h5>Example - Human Error</h5>
        <h6>This Calculator</h6>
        <p>
            Púrńimá (Full Moon) - 24 Mar 2024

            <br />
            Purnima start to dawn: 20:59:25
            <br />
            Dawn to Purnima end: 05:35:15
        </p>

        <h6>The Official Calculations</h6>
        <p>
            I don't know how they calculated the sunrise/dawn, but here it's hard to understand how the fasting
            date
            could be
            Mar 25th. So it's probably an error made by the human factor.

        <p>These models determine the precise positions of celestial bodies like stars, planets, the Moon, and the Sun
            at a given time. However, sunrise is influenced by additional factors beyond its exact position. Sunrise is
            affected by the atmosphere which refracts sunlight, causing the Sun to appear slightly higher above the
            horizon than it actually is. This affects the exact timing of sunrise and sunset.
            Also, sunrise depends on your location on Earth.

        <p>Atmospheric refraction, which causes celestial bodies to appear higher above the horizon than they would if
            the Earth had no atmosphere. Astronomy Engine uses a correction of 34 arcminutes. Real-world refraction
            varies based on air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are not taken into
            account.</p>
        <h3>Einstein's Theory of Relativity</h3>
        <p>Einstein's theory of relativity does have some subtle effects on the motion of celestial bodies, including
            the Moon. One effect is called relativistic precession, which causes the Moon's orbit to slowly wobble over
            time. However, the magnitude of these relativistic effects is incredibly small. They have a negligible
            impact on the overall geometry of the Earth-Sun-Moon system, which determines the Moon's phases. For most
            astronomical applications, including calculating lunar phases, the influence of relativity is insignificant.
            The high precision of models like VSOP (within 1 arcsecond for thousands of years) already accounts for the
            vast majority of the Moon's motion.</p>
        <p>The impact of relativity on sunrise and dawn calculations is also negligible for most purposes. Due to
            Earth's rotation, different parts of the Earth experience slightly different gravitational strengths.
            According to relativity, time runs slower in weaker gravity. This effect is minuscule but can cause a slight
            time difference in sunrise depending on your location. Gravity can bend light slightly. This effect is
            extremely weak, but it can theoretically cause the Sun to appear a tiny bit higher above the horizon during
            sunrise and sunset compared to a purely Newtonian calculation.</p>

                Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak: This model provides highly accurate predictions for lunar phases
                and eclipses, taking into account various perturbations and corrections.
            </li>
            <li>Solar and Lunar Almanac (SAA): This model includes detailed algorithms for calculating sunrise and
                sunset
                times,
                considering the Earth’s axial tilt and orbital eccentricity.
                NOAA Solar Calculator: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides a solar calculator
                that
                accounts for
                atmospheric refraction and other factors to give precise sunrise and sunset times.
                These models incorporate more detailed corrections and perturbations, making them suitable for
                high-precision
                astronomical calculations.</li>
